# Delayed-Despawning
This is a minecraft datapack that allows you to set how increase the amount of time items take to despawn from the regular 5 minute timer to 10 minutes, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. You can also disable *natural* item despawning entirely.

Although not supported, you can use /scoreboard to manually set a custom amount of time items will take to despawn.
